It is L3 cache slowest & largest also shared.

I am loading data in MM. Cache Limit will be 4 words. 
I will access data then depending on that find hit/miss ratio.

hitRatio = hitCount / accessCount
missRatio = 1 - hitRatio

for load(write) implement a simple write policy Write Through for now.

for read :
    if data not in cache : cache miss read from mm
    if data not in mm : retriving from secondary memory !! bus itana hi

for write :
    if block present in cache
        update both
    else
        update mm

Cache Grid Formatting Logic : Do
    Use tag, valid, dirty & data attributes.
